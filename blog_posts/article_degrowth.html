										<h1>What is Degrowth?</h1>
									</header>
									<dl>
										<dt>Degrowth [3]</dt>
										<dd>
											Degrowth is a political, economic, and social movement that advocates for the intentional
											reduction of production and consumption to enhance ecological sustainability, social equity, 
											and well-being, rather than pursuing perpetual economic growth.
										</dd>
									</dl>
									<p>
										It argues that the widespread assumption that GDP growth is the only way to sustain a good quality of living is false and has harmful social and ecological consequences.
										In this post I want to analyze the various arguments for Degrowth, some common criticism of the movement and what does this all means for us individually.

									<h1> Yes but, why?</h1>
									<p>
										The Degrowth movement can be argued for a variety of angles, from social to ecologic ones. In this paragraph we'll start by talking about the ecological argument for Degrowth.
										Well actually the argument is fairly straightforward: One way to pollute less, is to produce less, but since production is tightly linked with the GPD this means shrinking the economy.
										So the argument we'll actually analyze is more the answer to the questions "Is it actually necessary to stop increasing production?".

										<h3>Unsustainable energy demand</h3>
										<p>
										<!-- TODO: what about nuclear, can't we just use it-->
										The economy growth by about 3% every year. This may not seem like much but it still is an exponential growth and means that the economy will double every 23.45 years. 
										Furthermore since energy is tightly correlated to GDP, this means that unless something changes quickly, our energy consumption will also more or less double in the same amount of time.
										Now even In the magical world where we are only using renewables, these do not come from nothing, they require materials and the supply of al this materials will quickly finish when the
										demand for them is exponential. We are already being too slow in transitioning with the current energy demand, let alone an exponentially growing one.
										</p>
										
										<h3> Decoupling</h3>
										<p>
										This reasoning has an assumption:
										 That GDP growth will be forever linked with energy consumption.
										Three major institutions, OECD, UNEP and World Bank are trying to negate this assumption, that is decoupling GDP growth from energy consumption. But various studies either think that this is not possible at all or that it cannot happen fast enough [1,4].
										And this makes a lot of sense, as efficient as you can be, the GDP comes down to the production of value and when you producing something energy is needed. 
										
										Of course this is true for GDP-energy decoupling,
										but what we might say we are actually interested in is GDP-CO2 emissions decoupling.
										The literature I cited seems to move in the same direction, this is not really happening at all, and if it will it will not happen fast enough:  It is not enough to simply 'minimize' environmental impact - we must rapidly reduce it down to safe limits. Further more, the idea of simply ignoring GDP-energy productions sweeps under the rag the material problem that comes with it. 
										The raw materials that we would need to sustain current or growing levels of energy for 
										renewable sources will have a great ecological and political impact we are currently 
										not talking about enough. This is the same kind of not thinking about possible consequences
										that brought us in this mess in the first place. Simply substituting not renewable sources 
										with renewable one. An important concept to understand this is that of Planetary boundaries [2]:
										<dl>
											<dt>Planetary boundaries</dt>
											<dd>
												Planetary boundaries are scientific concepts introduced to define the safe operating limits for Earth within which humanity can continue to develop and thrive for generations to come. 
												The nine Planetary boundaries are: 
												Climate Change,
												 Biodiversity Loss,
												  Ocean Acidification,
												   Land-System Change, 
												   Freshwater Use, 
												   Biogeochemical Flows (Nitrogen and Phosphorus cycles),
												    Atmospheric Aerosol Loading, 
													Stratospheric Ozone Depletion, 
													Chemical Pollution, 
											</dd>	
										</dl>
										Even though we are mainly focused on the Climate Change Planetary boundary, this is not because the others are doing well. Planetary boundaries are not independent and are governed by complex planetary dynamics. When using massively certain resources, such as rare materials for renewables, these affect planetary boundaries drastically [2].
										I'm of course not advocating for not using renewables, the contrary, but we should not repeat the mistakes of the past, we should become more mindful and scrupulous about the use of new technologies and how they interact with the world.
										A very common opinion both in the literature and in the real world is that 
										ven if such decoupling is not happening fast enough, that the market, pushed by the demand of cheap energy will produce a new technology to make it possible. 
										I personally believe that this is a deeply problematic way to think of this, we can not base the future of humanity on hope on some sort of savior technology we have no evidence for.
										</p>
										<h2>What is happening to other Planetary boundaries</h2>
										As I mentioned before, planetary boundaries are not indipendent, for this reason the crisis happening around us is actually much more serious than we originally assumed.
										The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), a United Nations' taskforce monitoring biodiversity published a report in 2019 (((cite))) that found that since 1970, the number of birds, and mammals, reptiles and amphibians has dropped more than half and that a quarter of all species are at risk of extintion,
										Around 90% of the heat from global working gets absorbed by the ocean, disrupting nutrient cycles. Oceans are getting more acid because of the absorption of C02. Reefs once full of life are now turning into white lands of bones. UN scientists have found that 40% of earth planet's soils are now seriously degraded and this is observed in the continous decline in crop yields.
										Keep in mind that these are not conclusions of a couple of scientists. This the conclusion of official international task forces analyzing the whole literature on the subjects.
										<h3>Conclusion</h3>
										<p>
										In conclusion, it appears we have no choice but to find a way for our society to continue
										 functioning without relying on economic growth if we are to effectively address climate 
										 change. <br><br>
										
										Even if we choose to disregard climate change, ignoring its potentially catastrophic 
										consequences, we are still faced with an imminent challenge: peak oil has already been
										 reached, occurring 20 years ago. The era of abundant, almost free energy that significantly
										  elevated living standards in the global north is nearing its end. This shift challenges the
										   long-held assumption that we will always have sufficient energy for everything.

										However, it's important to end on a hopeful note. The Degrowth movement offers tangible
										 proposals for sustaining society without relying on individual sacrifices. Contrary to 
										 prioritizing economic growth, which often comes at the cost of the environment and our
										  quality of life—leaving us more isolated and with less free time—the Degrowth movement
										   advocates for a shift in focus. Much like how moving beyond the third postulate of 
										   Euclidean geometry opened up new worlds of understanding, rethinking the necessity 
										   of perpetual economic growth could unveil alternative, viable societal models. This 
										   article aims to illustrate that such an alternative world is not only deeply appealing
										    but also achievable.
										</p>

									<h1>How do we get there?</h1>
									<p>
										The first part of this blog post, explained why degrowth is inevitable, the question is how it can become socially sustainable, i.e. a prosperous and stable, rather than a catastrophic, descent. It did not address the question on what new economic system we should adopt instead, nor if any other sustainable system exists.
										First of all, our current economic system is not sustainable, second of all, in theory meeting all our needs does not require a constant increase in production. Once a population is stable (or decreasing), as in most countries in the Global North we could in theory simply keep production constant, matching the demand.
										Of course, whether a system of this kind actually can exist is left to be seen. But it is already clear that this is already possible in smaller, and less technological communities. The question becomes whether this is possible to do on a country-global scale while maintaining current (or better) levels of access to healthcare, food and shelter. And also with a sustainable-conscious use technology, traveling and others.
									
										I believe that the answer to this is yes, and since the solution is not unique, and explaining entirely how a different society could work is impossible for a single human being. I will only draw a sketch of how this world could look like, focusing on the direction to take from where we are now. And as we use to say, the details can be figured out along the way.
										I would like to start on a bright note by saying that some Degrowth mindset is already present in various institution and in our culture. 
										This is not a new idea we all need to be convinced of from scratch. All the regulations governing minimum industry requirements for employees standards of living such as minimum wage, holydays and others are in some sense "Degrowth".
										What I mean is that we are already not maximizing profit at the (total) expanse of everything else. We are still too much focused on growth of course, but not totally, and this is a big difference.
										There are already some degrowth ideas and values in our society. But in some ways a totally degrowth society would have to look much different from ours and many things are not obvious at all on how they could function. In this paragraph I would like to talk about how we could sustainably (from a quality of life sense) transition to a degrowth society.
										
										<h3>Shortened work-week</h3>
										<p>
											Maximizing profit has lead to the practice of throws away unsold products in various sector (((CITE))). That is, we are producing for the sake of producing and not to meet the actual demand.
											Thus we are already in the situation where we could de working less, reducing the production
											 of not needed goods. 

											This is not obvious but this policy (or related) are actually fundamental to transition to a more sustainable society. More free time also means more time for community work. This makes space for a lot of more community based solutions for personal needs we would have more time to take care of our need and of those of others
							                , depending on our skills and disposition, we would have more time to devote to communal gardens, repair cafes or help out with needs of our local community. Voluntary community work takes us out of our insulations and keeps the community united. Community based solutions are more resilient (((CITE))). As a side note, less working time would give us the opportunity to travel slower, we would not need to take the plane 
											because we don't have time and taking a longer bus or train ride would also be ok.
											  <br><br>

											I like to think of this the following way. Just as when we walt to be silent we need to walk slowly and carefully think of each step, 
											If we want to diminish our impact on thRockström, Johan, et al. “Planetary Boundaries: Exploring the Safe Operating Space for Humanity.” Ecology and Society, vol. 14, no. 2, 2009. JSTOR, http://www.jstor.org/stable/26268316. Accessed 27 Feb. 2024.e environment we need to live slower: work less and work on what the community actually need, grow our slow food, slowly repair our things (compared to rebuying) and take the time to travel.
											<h4>But what about the economy?</h4>
											<p>
												This will have good environmental consequences, but we need to answer
											  some common criticisms of this policy (((answer common criticisms of this policy))).

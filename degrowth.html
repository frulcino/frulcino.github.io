                    Degrowth is a socio-economic political movement critical of the concept of growth measured as gross domestic product.

                It argues that the widespread assumption that GDP growth is the only way to sustain a
                 good quality of living is false and has harmful social and ecological consequences.
                In this post I want to analyse the various arguments for degrowth, some common criticism 
                of the movement and what does this all means for us individually. <br>
                I will also share some thoughts for other environmentally conscious mathematicians
                on what is the role of mathematics in all of this. Not because I believe mathematics is the answer to this problem, quite the opposite, but it is the tool I have been given and I believe it will play a (and more) part in this.

            <h1> Yes but, why? </h1>
            <p>
                The Degrowth movement can be argued for a variety of angles, from social to ecologic ones. In this paragraph we'll start by talking about the ecological argument for Degrowth.
                Well actually the argument is fairly straightforward: One way to pollute less, is to produce less, but since production is tigtly linked with the GPD this means shrinking the economy.
                So the argument we'll actually analyse is more the answer to the questions "Is it actually necessary to stop increasing production?" 
                The growth assumption is so deeply rooted in our society is that the economy growth by about 3% every year. 
                This may not seem like much but it still is an exponential growth and means that the economy will double every 23.45 years. 
                Furthermore since energy is tightly correlated to GDP, this means that unless something changes quickly, our energy consumption will also more or less double in the same amount of time.
                Now even In the magical world where we are only using renewables, these do not come from nothing, they require materials and the supply of al this materials will quickly finish when the demand for them is exponential.
                Of course this reasonment has an assumption:
                 That GDP growth will be forever linked with energy consumption.
                This is what a lot of occidental countries are trying to change (CIE). But various studies either think that this is not possible at all (((CITE))) or that it cannot happen fast enough (((CITE))).
                And this makes a lot of sense, as efficient as you can be, the GDP comes down to production of value and when you producing something energy is needed. 
                
                Of course this is true for GDP-energy decoupling,
                 but what we might say we are actually interested in is GDP-CO2emissions decoupling.
                The literature I cited seems to move in the same direction, this is not really happening at all, and if it will it will not happen fast enough. Further more, the idea of simply ignoring GDP-energy productions sweeps under the rag the material problem that comes with it. 
                The raw materials that we would need to sustain current or growing levels of energy for renewable sources will have a great ecological and political impact we are currently not talking about enough. This is the same kind of not thinking about possible consequences that brought us in this mess in the first place. Simply substituting not renewable sources with renewable one.
                I'm of course not advocating for not usinge renewables, the contrary, but we should not repeat the mistakes of the past, we should become more mindfull and scupolous about the use of new technologies and how they interact with the world.
                A very common opinion both in the literature and in the real world is that even if such decoupling is not happening fast enough, that the market, pushed by the demand of cheap energy will produce a new technology to make it possible. 
                I personally believe that this is a deeply problematic way to think of this, we can not base the future of humanity on hope on some sort of savior technology we have no evidence for, otherwise its just wishfull thinking (DOES THIS MEAN SOMETHING ELSE?)
                
                In conclusion we really seems like to not have a choice if we want to actually tackle climate change but to find so that our society will keep functioning even when there is no more economic growth.
                
                This is actually the case even if we decide to not care about climate change, ignoring all the catastrophic consequences this woul have in the first place, peak oil is soon approching, so soon that it actually happened 20 years ago (CITE).
                The big gulp of almost free energy we had at our disposal and which raised the global north living standars to this level is almost over, and with it, the assumption that we will always have enough energy for everything.

                To not finish with a dark note, the degrowth movement has some real concrete proposals to make this kind of society possible, and they do not rely on the sacrifice of the individuals. This is actually quite the opposite,
                with the focus on economic growth, we have maximized for profit at the expanse of environment but also our living, we are all more isolated and with less free time, all to satisfy the always more demanding assumption to produce more, to grow the economy, for growth for the sake of growth.
                As much as renouncing the to the third's Euclide postulate of geometry made us discover other worlds, we should at least be thinking on the possibility that the assumption that economic growth is foundamental for a society to work may also not hold.
                I hope in this article to show you that this alternative world not just deeply alluring, but also possible.

            <h1>How do we get there?</h1>
            <p>
                I would like to start on a bright note by saying that some Degrowth mindset is already present in various institution and in our colture. 
                This is not a new idea we all need to be convinced of from scratch. All the regulations govering minimum industry requirements for employees standards of living such as minimum wage, holydays and others are in some sense "Degrowth".
                What I mean is that we are already not maximizing profit at the (total) expanse of everything else. We are still too much focused on growth of cuorse, but not totally, and this is a big difference.
                There are already some degrowth ideas and values in our society. But in some ways a totally degrowth society would have to look much different from ours and many things are not obvious at all on how they could function. In this paragraph I would like to talk about how we could sustainably (from a quality of life sense) transition to a degrowth society.
                To stop GDP growth we need to stop increasing products productions... WHICH SECTORS HOW?

                    <h1>Bring Math into Fables... Mafables?</h1>
                    <p> Imagine you're a child. You can't wait to go outside and play, but first, you have to tackle that wall of equations sitting on your desk. You give it a shot, but your result doesn't match the one in the book. Meanwhile, you hear the birds in the backyard singing.

                        You eventually spot your mistake: an '8' mysteriously turned into a '6' during your first attempt. Frustrated, you start over, but the result is still off. The numbers seem to lose their meaning, and you begin questioning everything: 'Am I really adding fractions correctly?' you wonder. Oops, another error!
                        
                        Finally, your results match, and you mutter, 'Math is so boring. I hate it.' Now, you rush outside to play. <br> <br>
                        
                        Yet, mathematics follows you. It's in the petals of the flowers you're examining, with the number of petals in each ring following the Fibonacci sequence. Trigonometric functions seem to play along with the birds' chirping. How many ways can you turn that rock to make the same shape? <br> <br>
                        
                        While I understand that the grind of learning mathematics might be necessary, I believe we should strive to present each subject in the most engaging way possible. Not only because engaged students learn better, but also because mathematics is a series of metaphors that start with fundamental operations. Consider how adding 3 to 2 can be visualized as either adding 3 balls to a container with 2 or moving along the number line.
                        
                        These are different ways to grasp the same concept. The more perspectives we have, the more each operation becomes real. Eventually, manipulating various mathematical objects, from summing integers to abstract math, can transport you to a different world in your mind. Therefore, being creative in teaching results in a better understanding of the subject because it makes mathematics more tangible.
                        
                        In this article, I want to share my experiences as a Math Educator, along with some ideas and future projects for some engaging math activities.
